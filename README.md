Programming Utils
=================

There are always that set of utilities that you end up needing to use on many
projects out there. Instead of keep rewriting those for new projects, I finally
decided to create a repository to host them.

Unless otherwise stated in the utility directory, the utilities here are use a
3-clause BSD license ("BSD-new").

Quick summary of utilities

  variables, while keeping their internal bits intact.
- [rapidjson_utils](rapidjson_utils): An utility to aid with RapidJSON common
  tasks.
